    "# Financial Chatbot Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a simple AI-powered financial chatbot prototype using Python, Flask, and pandas. The chatbot is designed to answer predefined financial questions based on analyzed financial data (e.g., from 10-K filings). This prototype demonstrates foundational chatbot concepts and basic interaction via a web interface.\n",

    "This financial chatbot prototype demonstrates a practical introduction to building AI-driven conversational agents tailored for financial analysis. By leveraging Python, Flask, and pandas, the project showcases how predefined financial queries can be efficiently handled through a simple web interface. While this prototype operates with static responses, it lays the foundation for more advanced developments, such as integrating real-time data and natural language processing. This project serves as a valuable learning tool and a stepping stone toward creating more sophisticated AI chatbots in the financial domain.\n",
